# The input species tree with internal nodes labeled:            (((a,(x,(y,z)<1>)<2>)<3>,b)<4>,(c,d)<5>)<6>
# The polyploid clade:                                           x, y, z
# Result will be written to file:                                test_out/manual_sims_out/checknum_test.txt
# Hybrid node identified as:                                     <2>
# No copy node defined
# Searching all possible copy nodes.
# --checknums set. NOT doing reconciliations, just running some numbers for you...
